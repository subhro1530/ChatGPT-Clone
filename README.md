# ChatBOT3

## A better version of ChatGPT capable of handling single requests instead of multiple prompts in a chat.

## Features:

1.  The chatBot is capable of handling multiple requests from the user at a time which makes the process of optimization easy and follows the principle of low code no code.

2.  It has been build as such that it is capable of running on desktop only. Still newer versions may solve the problems as well
